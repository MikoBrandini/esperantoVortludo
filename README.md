# Vortludo (Word Game)
Project#1 General Assembly
Beat the clock and learn some basic Esperanto!
A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc. #### Planning Phase

jQuery was used to access DOM elements. The visibility of \<div\>s were constantly manipualted in order to simulate the effect of windwows. The contents of the actual game(questions and answers) were all located inside an array. The array is made up of a series of objects which contain the questions and answers for each round. 

This is a mobile game. It was created with the dimensions of an iPhone 5 (320x568) in mind.
